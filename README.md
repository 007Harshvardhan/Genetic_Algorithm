## 1. Introduction

In numerous real-world applications, solving under-determined systems of equations where the number of measurements is much smaller than the number of unknowns is a common challenge. One effective approach leverages the sparsity of the unknown solution, meaning only a few components are non-zero. This property is extensively utilized in fields like signal processing, image compression, and compressed sensing.

This project aims to solve the sparse signal recovery problem using a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**. The system under consideration is represented by the equation:

\[
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{H}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{n}
\]

Where:
- \(\mathbf{y}\) is the \(M \times 1\) measurement vector.
- \(\mathbf{H}\) is the \(M \times N\) dictionary matrix with \(M \ll N\).
- \(\mathbf{x}\) is the \(N \times 1\) sparse desired vector with only \(K\) non-zero entries.
- \(\mathbf{n}\) represents additive white Gaussian noise.

Our objective is to recover the sparse vector \(\mathbf{x}\) from the measurement vector \(\mathbf{y}\) and the dictionary matrix \(\mathbf{H}\) using a Genetic Algorithm. GA, inspired by natural selection and genetics, will be employed to minimize the error between the observed measurement \(\mathbf{y}\) and the modeled signal \(\mathbf{H}\mathbf{x}\), leading to an accurate estimation of the sparse vector \(\mathbf{x}\).

## 2. Problem Formulation

The primary challenge is **sparse signal recovery** in an under-determined system. Given the system:

\[
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{H}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{n}
\]

- **\(\mathbf{y}\)**: Measurement vector.
- **\(\mathbf{H}\)**: Known dictionary matrix.
- **\(\mathbf{n}\)**: Additive white Gaussian noise.
- **\(\mathbf{x}\)**: Unknown sparse vector with sparsity \(K\) (i.e., only \(K\) non-zero entries).

Since \(M < N\), the system has infinitely many solutions. However, leveraging the sparsity of \(\mathbf{x}\) reduces the solution space, allowing optimization techniques like GA to efficiently find a suitable solution.

### Sparse Vector Generation

The sparse vector \(\mathbf{x}\) is generated with the following characteristics:
- Contains mostly zero elements.
- Only \(K\) entries are non-zero.
- Non-zero values are drawn from a Gaussian distribution \(N(0.05, 1)\).

This ensures that \(\mathbf{x}\) maintains its sparsity throughout the GA execution.

### Cost Function

The **cost function** measures the error between the observed measurement vector \(\mathbf{y}\) and the modeled signal \(\mathbf{H}\mathbf{x}\). It is defined as:

\[
J(\mathbf{x}) = \|\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{H}\mathbf{x}\|_2^2
\]

This represents the sum of squared differences between the actual measurement vector and the reconstructed signal. The goal is to find the sparse vector \(\mathbf{x}\) that **minimizes** this cost function.

## 3. Genetic Algorithm (GA) Approach

A **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** is an iterative search heuristic that mimics the process of natural evolution. It evolves a population of candidate solutions (chromosomes) through selection, crossover, and mutation operations to optimize the cost function \(J(\mathbf{x})\).

### 3.1 GA Components

#### Population Initialization

- **Population Size**: 100 individuals.
- Each individual represents a sparse vector \(\mathbf{x}\) with \(N\) genes.
- Initialized using the `generateSparseVector()` function to ensure sparsity (only \(K\) non-zero entries).

#### Fitness Function

- Evaluated using the cost function \(J(\mathbf{x}) = \|\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{H}\mathbf{x}\|_2^2\).
- Individuals with **lower** cost values are considered **fitter**, as they provide a better approximation to the measured vector \(\mathbf{y}\).

#### Selection

- **Tournament Selection**: A subset of individuals is randomly chosen, and the fittest individual in this subset is selected as a parent.
- This process is repeated to select two parents for crossover.
- Selected parents are more likely to produce fitter offspring, propagating desirable traits.

#### Crossover

- **Single-Point Crossover**: A random crossover point is selected, and genes after this point are swapped between two parents to produce offspring.
- **Crossover Rate**: 0.7 (70% of the population undergoes crossover each generation).

#### Mutation

- Introduces random changes to maintain diversity in the population.
- Each gene has a **small probability** (0.01) of mutation.
- If a gene mutates, it is perturbed by a small random value drawn from a uniform distribution.
- Prevents premature convergence to suboptimal solutions.

### 3.2 Execution of GA

The Genetic Algorithm is executed for a maximum of **1000 generations**. Each generation involves the following steps:

1. **Selection**: Two parents are selected using tournament selection.
2. **Crossover**: Parents undergo crossover with a probability of 0.7 to produce two offspring.
3. **Mutation**: Each offspring has a 1% chance of mutation, introducing random perturbations to its genes.
4. **Evaluation**: The new population is evaluated using the cost function.
5. **Replacement**: The old population is replaced by the new population.

At regular intervals (every 100 generations), the algorithm prints the best cost value observed so far to monitor progress.

## 4. Experimentation

### 4.1 Experimental Setup

The following parameters were used for the Genetic Algorithm:

- **Population Size**: 100
- **Number of Generations**: 1000
- **Crossover Rate**: 0.7
- **Mutation Rate**: 0.01
- **Number of Non-zero Entries (K)**: 5
- **Measurement Vector (y) Length (M)**: 20
- **Sparse Vector (x) Length (N)**: 50

**Dictionary Matrix \(\mathbf{H}\)**:
- Each element is drawn from a standard Gaussian distribution \(N(0, 1)\).

**Measurement Vector \(\mathbf{y}\)**:
- Generated as a noisy observation by adding a small amount of random noise to the true signal \(\mathbf{H}\mathbf{x}\).

### 4.2 Results and Visualizations

The Genetic Algorithm successfully recovered a sparse approximation of \(\mathbf{x}\) that closely matched the original signal after several generations. Over the course of 1000 generations, the cost function consistently decreased, indicating effective minimization of the reconstruction error.

#### Visualization of Cost Function

![Cost Function Over Generations](path_to_cost_function_plot.png)

*The plot of the cost function over generations shows a rapid decline in the early stages of the algorithm, followed by a slower convergence towards the end. This behavior is typical of Genetic Algorithms, where initial improvements are made quickly, and the algorithm takes longer to refine the solution as it approaches the global minimum.*

## 5. Conclusions

The experiment demonstrated that the **Genetic Algorithm** is a viable approach for solving the sparse signal recovery problem in under-determined systems. The GA successfully minimized the reconstruction error by evolving a population of candidate sparse vectors over multiple generations.

**Advantages of Using GA:**
- **Handles Non-Convex Optimization**: GA can navigate complex search spaces effectively.
- **Robustness**: Capable of exploring a large search space without getting easily trapped in local minima.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Slow Convergence**: GA tends to converge slowly as the population approaches the optimal solution, evident from the gradual reduction in the cost function in later stages.

**Future Work:**
- Explore other optimization techniques such as **Simulated Annealing** or **Particle Swarm Optimization** to compare their performance with GA.
- Further optimize GA parameters like mutation rate and crossover probability for enhanced performance.

## 1. Introduction

In numerous real-world applications, solving under-determined systems of equations where the number of measurements is much smaller than the number of unknowns is a common challenge. One effective approach leverages the sparsity of the unknown solution, meaning only a few components are non-zero. This property is extensively utilized in fields like signal processing, image compression, and compressed sensing.

This project aims to solve the sparse signal recovery problem using a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**. The system under consideration is represented by the equation:

\[
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{H}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{n}
\]

Where:
- \(\mathbf{y}\) is the \(M \times 1\) measurement vector.
- \(\mathbf{H}\) is the \(M \times N\) dictionary matrix with \(M \ll N\).
- \(\mathbf{x}\) is the \(N \times 1\) sparse desired vector with only \(K\) non-zero entries.
- \(\mathbf{n}\) represents additive white Gaussian noise.

Our objective is to recover the sparse vector \(\mathbf{x}\) from the measurement vector \(\mathbf{y}\) and the dictionary matrix \(\mathbf{H}\) using a Genetic Algorithm. GA, inspired by natural selection and genetics, will be employed to minimize the error between the observed measurement \(\mathbf{y}\) and the modeled signal \(\mathbf{H}\mathbf{x}\), leading to an accurate estimation of the sparse vector \(\mathbf{x}\).

## 2. Problem Formulation

The primary challenge is **sparse signal recovery** in an under-determined system. Given the system:

\[
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{H}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{n}
\]

- **\(\mathbf{y}\)**: Measurement vector.
- **\(\mathbf{H}\)**: Known dictionary matrix.
- **\(\mathbf{n}\)**: Additive white Gaussian noise.
- **\(\mathbf{x}\)**: Unknown sparse vector with sparsity \(K\) (i.e., only \(K\) non-zero entries).

Since \(M < N\), the system has infinitely many solutions. However, leveraging the sparsity of \(\mathbf{x}\) reduces the solution space, allowing optimization techniques like GA to efficiently find a suitable solution.

### Sparse Vector Generation

The sparse vector \(\mathbf{x}\) is generated with the following characteristics:
- Contains mostly zero elements.
- Only \(K\) entries are non-zero.
- Non-zero values are drawn from a Gaussian distribution \(N(0.05, 1)\).

This ensures that \(\mathbf{x}\) maintains its sparsity throughout the GA execution.

### Cost Function

The **cost function** measures the error between the observed measurement vector \(\mathbf{y}\) and the modeled signal \(\mathbf{H}\mathbf{x}\). It is defined as:

\[
J(\mathbf{x}) = \|\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{H}\mathbf{x}\|_2^2
\]

This represents the sum of squared differences between the actual measurement vector and the reconstructed signal. The goal is to find the sparse vector \(\mathbf{x}\) that **minimizes** this cost function.

## 3. Genetic Algorithm (GA) Approach

A **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** is an iterative search heuristic that mimics the process of natural evolution. It evolves a population of candidate solutions (chromosomes) through selection, crossover, and mutation operations to optimize the cost function \(J(\mathbf{x})\).

### 3.1 GA Components

#### Population Initialization

- **Population Size**: 100 individuals.
- Each individual represents a sparse vector \(\mathbf{x}\) with \(N\) genes.
- Initialized using the `generateSparseVector()` function to ensure sparsity (only \(K\) non-zero entries).

#### Fitness Function

- Evaluated using the cost function \(J(\mathbf{x}) = \|\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{H}\mathbf{x}\|_2^2\).
- Individuals with **lower** cost values are considered **fitter**, as they provide a better approximation to the measured vector \(\mathbf{y}\).

#### Selection

- **Tournament Selection**: A subset of individuals is randomly chosen, and the fittest individual in this subset is selected as a parent.
- This process is repeated to select two parents for crossover.
- Selected parents are more likely to produce fitter offspring, propagating desirable traits.

#### Crossover

- **Single-Point Crossover**: A random crossover point is selected, and genes after this point are swapped between two parents to produce offspring.
- **Crossover Rate**: 0.7 (70% of the population undergoes crossover each generation).

#### Mutation

- Introduces random changes to maintain diversity in the population.
- Each gene has a **small probability** (0.01) of mutation.
- If a gene mutates, it is perturbed by a small random value drawn from a uniform distribution.
- Prevents premature convergence to suboptimal solutions.

### 3.2 Execution of GA

The Genetic Algorithm is executed for a maximum of **1000 generations**. Each generation involves the following steps:

1. **Selection**: Two parents are selected using tournament selection.
2. **Crossover**: Parents undergo crossover with a probability of 0.7 to produce two offspring.
3. **Mutation**: Each offspring has a 1% chance of mutation, introducing random perturbations to its genes.
4. **Evaluation**: The new population is evaluated using the cost function.
5. **Replacement**: The old population is replaced by the new population.

At regular intervals (every 100 generations), the algorithm prints the best cost value observed so far to monitor progress.

## 4. Experimentation

### 4.1 Experimental Setup

The following parameters were used for the Genetic Algorithm:

- **Population Size**: 100
- **Number of Generations**: 1000
- **Crossover Rate**: 0.7
- **Mutation Rate**: 0.01
- **Number of Non-zero Entries (K)**: 5
- **Measurement Vector (y) Length (M)**: 20
- **Sparse Vector (x) Length (N)**: 50

**Dictionary Matrix \(\mathbf{H}\)**:
- Each element is drawn from a standard Gaussian distribution \(N(0, 1)\).

**Measurement Vector \(\mathbf{y}\)**:
- Generated as a noisy observation by adding a small amount of random noise to the true signal \(\mathbf{H}\mathbf{x}\).

### 4.2 Results and Visualizations

The Genetic Algorithm successfully recovered a sparse approximation of \(\mathbf{x}\) that closely matched the original signal after several generations. Over the course of 1000 generations, the cost function consistently decreased, indicating effective minimization of the reconstruction error.

#### Visualization of Cost Function

*The plot of the cost function over generations shows a rapid decline in the early stages of the algorithm, followed by a slower convergence towards the end. This behavior is typical of Genetic Algorithms, where initial improvements are made quickly, and the algorithm takes longer to refine the solution as it approaches the global minimum.*

## 5. Conclusions

The experiment demonstrated that the **Genetic Algorithm** is a viable approach for solving the sparse signal recovery problem in under-determined systems. The GA successfully minimized the reconstruction error by evolving a population of candidate sparse vectors over multiple generations.

**Advantages of Using GA:**
- **Handles Non-Convex Optimization**: GA can navigate complex search spaces effectively.
- **Robustness**: Capable of exploring a large search space without getting easily trapped in local minima.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Slow Convergence**: GA tends to converge slowly as the population approaches the optimal solution, evident from the gradual reduction in the cost function in later stages.
